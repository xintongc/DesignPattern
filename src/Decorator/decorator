The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically

You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality
at run time

It is more flexible than inheritance

Simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes

Rather than rewrite old code you can extend with new code
