It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated

- The method that orders the object
- The factories that build the object
- The final objects
- The final ohjects contain objects that use the Strategy Pattern
    -Composition: Object class fields are objects




What can you do with an abstract factory?

- Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
- Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during time
- You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through common interfaces
- The Bad: Things can get complicated
